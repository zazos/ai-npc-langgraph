# History and Lore of Aetheria

## The Great Disjunction
**Date:** 100 Years Before Present (100 YBP).

**Event Summary:**
Before the Disjunction, Aetheria was a unified landmass where magic and technology coexisted in balance. The catastrophe was triggered by the **"Tower of Babel" project**, an attempt by early mage-scientists to drill into the planet’s core to access the source of all magic.

The drill shattered the planetary Ley-Weave. The resulting shockwave, known as **The Great Disjunction**, physically ripped the continent apart and altered the laws of physics in local pockets, creating the distinct biomes (Neon Spires, Whispering Glade, etc.) seen today.

**Consequences:**
1.  **Loss of Flight:** Natural flight became impossible due to erratic gravity currents; only Aether-powered ships can fly now.
2.  **The Schisms:** Invisible barriers of chaotic magic formed between regions.
3.  **Memory Rot:** 50% of the population instantly lost their memories of the world before the event.

## The Aether Crystals
**Origin:**
Aether Crystals are not rocks; they are the crystallized blood of the planet, solidified Mana that seeped to the surface after the Disjunction. They glow with a soft, pulsing light (color depends on purity: Blue = Pure, Red = Volatile, Black = Corrupted).

**The Crisis: The Fading Light**
In the last decade, Aether Crystals have begun to disappear.
* **Scientific Theory:** The Synod believes the planet is "healing" the wounds, reabsorbing the mana.
* **Druidic Belief:** The Root-Walkers believe a parasitic entity, known as the **"Void Eater,"** has awoken and is consuming the world's soul.
* **Economic Impact:** The scarcity of crystals has driven up the price of energy, pushing the factions toward total war.

## Myths and Prophecies

### The Prophecy of the Unbound Thread
Found carved into the obsidian walls of the Iron Depths, this prophecy haunts the leaders of all factions.

> *"When the silver sky falls and the roots turn to ash,*
> *The Unbound Thread shall stitch the gash.*
> *One heart of iron, one mind of glass,*
> *Or all that is, shall come to pass."*

**Interpretation:**
Scholars debate the meaning endlessly.
* **"Silver sky falls"** is thought to refer to the collapse of The Neon Spires.
* **"Roots turn to ash"** implies the burning of The Whispering Glade.
* **"The Unbound Thread"** is believed to be a person—a hero (or villain) who possesses no magical alignment, allowing them to cross Schisms without a Resonator. This figure is the only one capable of reuniting the Ley-Weave.

### The Legend of the Ghost Whale
Sailors speak of a massive, translucent whale that swims through the skies above the cloud layer. It is said that the Ghost Whale is the physical manifestation of all the memories lost during the Great Disjunction. To catch it is to learn the ultimate truth of the universe, but all who chase it vanish forever.
