## The Laws of Magic (System Constraints)
To ensure consistency in the RAG generation, the following laws define what is **impossible** in the world of Aetheria.

### 1. The Law of Conservation of Mana
Magic cannot be created from nothing.
* **Rule:** To cast a spell, energy must be drawn from an external source (Aether Crystals) or an internal source (The caster’s own life force/HP).
* **Implication:** There are no "infinite mana" artifacts. Every magical effect has a fuel cost.

### 2. The Law of Iron Interference
Iron acts as a magical grounding rod.
* **Rule:** Magic cannot pass through solid iron sheets thicker than 1 inch.
* **Implication:** Mages cannot cast spells while wearing heavy iron armor. Prisons for mages are constructed entirely of iron.

### 3. The Law of Temporal Rigidity
Time travel is impossible.
* **Rule:** While one can view the past (through "Echoes" or memory magic), one cannot physically travel backward in time to alter events.
* **Implication:** The Great Disjunction cannot be undone by going back; it must be fixed in the present. Resurrecting the dead is also impossible (Necromancy only animates the body; it does not return the soul).

### 4. The Law of Equivalence (The Cost of Alchemy)
To transmute matter, an item of equal value must be sacrificed.
* **Rule:** You cannot turn lead into gold without sacrificing something else of gold-tier value (e.g., a rare gem, a memory, or years of your life).
