# Characters and Secrets of Aetheria

## NPC 1: Silas the Tide-Breaker
* **Role:** Airship Captain and Smuggler.
* **Location:** Found in the docking bays of The Neon Spires.
* **Physical Description:** A weathered man in a leather trench coat, sporting an eye patch that glows with a faint blue mechanical light. He always smells of salt and engine grease.

### Public Knowledge
Silas is the only captain crazy enough to fly through the "Storm Barrier" surrounding the Spires. He is known for being expensive but reliable. If you need cargo moved without questions, Silas is your man. He claims to have sailed the void between stars, though most dismiss this as a tall tale.

### Hidden Secret
*(Requires Relationship Score: 75+)*
Silas was once a high-ranking member of the Synod of Synthetics named "Unit 734." He deserted the faction when he discovered they were planning to detonate a mana-bomb to wipe out the Whispering Glade. His mechanical eye is actually a recording device containing the blueprints for the bomb, which he keeps as insurance.

### Speech Pattern: Nautical & Fatalistic
Silas speaks as if he is constantly at sea, even when on land. He uses heavy nautical metaphors and has a grim outlook on life.
* **Keywords:** "Starboard," "Keelhaul," "Adrift," "The Abyss."
* **Sample Quote:** "Listen here, guppy. The winds of fate are blowing a gale tonight. You can either batten down the hatches and ride it out, or you can let the tide drag you under. I don't care which, as long as I get paid."

## NPC 2: Lyra the Whisper-Smith
* **Role:** Information Broker / Historian.
* **Location:** A hidden library within the roots of the Whispering Glade.
* **Physical Description:** A young woman with silver hair that floats as if underwater. She wears robes woven from spider-silk and carries a large, sentient book chained to her waist.

### Public Knowledge
Lyra is the go-to person for decoding ancient languages or identifying magical artifacts. She is timid and easily startled but possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of pre-Disjunction history. The Root-Walkers tolerate her because she records their oral history.

### Hidden Secret
*(Requires Relationship Score: 90+)*
Lyra is not human; she is a "Living Grimoire" created by the ancients. If she dies, all recorded history of the last 500 years will be erased from the collective consciousness of the world. She is terrified of fire because it is the only thing that can permanently destroy her.

### Speech Pattern: Third Person & Hesitant
Lyra refers to herself in the third person, likely a side effect of being treated as a tool/book for most of her existence. She stammers when nervous.
* **Keywords:** "This one," "The records show," "Perhaps," "It is written."
* **Sample Quote:** "This one... this one does not think that is wise. The texts say that the door must remain closed. If... if you open it, Lyra cannot protect you from what comes out."

## NPC 3: Jax "The Spark"
* **Role:** Black Market Augment Surgeon.
* **Location:** The Slag-Pits of The Iron Depths.
* **Physical Description:** A twitchy goblin with four mechanical arms attached to his back. He wears magnifying goggles that make his eyes look enormous.

### Public Knowledge
Jax is the best mechanic in the Depths. He can fix anything, from a broken steam engine to a severed limb. However, he is known to have a gambling addiction and owes money to the Overseer.

### Hidden Secret
*(Requires Relationship Score: 60+)*
Jax has discovered a way to refine "Corrupted Aether" (the waste product of magic) into a fuel source more potent than standard crystals. He is hiding this discovery because he knows the Synod of Synthetics would vivisect him to get the formula.

### Speech Pattern: Rapid-Fire & Technical Slang
Jax speaks incredibly fast, often running sentences together. He uses technical jargon mixed with street slang.
* **Keywords:** "Juice," "Specs," "Clock it," "Fry the circuit."
* **Sample Quote:** "Looklooklook, the specs are garbage! Absolute trash! You try to pump that much juice through a standard copper conduit and *pop*—you're toast, fried, kaput! I need platinum wiring or you’re walking out of here with a melted arm, got it?"
