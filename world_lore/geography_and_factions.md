# Geography and Factions of Aetheria

## Overview
Aetheria is a fractured world, held together by threads of raw magic known as the Ley-Weave. Following the Great Disjunction, the world was split into distinct biomes, each evolving separately under the influence of extreme magical polarity.

## Region 1: The Neon Spires
**Description:**
Located on the northern precipice of the continent, The Neon Spires is a vertical metropolis of glass, chrome, and solidified mana. It is a place of perpetual twilight, illuminated only by the humming violet and blue ley-lines that run through the architecture like circuitry. The air smells of ozone and static. It is the center of technological advancement and magical study.

* **Climate:** Cold, dry, and electrically charged.
* **Hazards:** Arc-storms (sudden lightning discharges), Mana-burn from unshielded conduits.

### The ruling Faction: The Synod of Synthetics
The Spires are governed by the **Synod of Synthetics**, a technocratic order that believes flesh is a limitation to magical potential. They replace their limbs with aether-infused prosthetics.

* **Leader:** **Grand Architect Vex**. Vex is no longer fully human; his consciousness is partially uploaded into the city's central mana-grid. He is cold, calculating, and obsessed with efficiency.
* **Political Stance:** **Neutral / Transactional**. The Synod is willing to trade technology for raw resources, but they view outsiders as "obsolete variables." They are currently hostile toward The Verdant Circle, viewing nature as chaotic inefficiency.

## Region 2: The Whispering Glade
**Description:**
To the southwest lies The Whispering Glade, a dense, bioluminescent jungle where flora grows to impossible sizes. The canopy is so thick that sunlight never touches the forest floor; instead, the area is lit by glowing fungi and the radiant sap of Elder Trees. The silence here is unnatural, broken only by the sound of the wind, which is said to carry the voices of the ancestors.

* **Climate:** Humid, warm, and stagnant.
* **Hazards:** Hallucinogenic spores, predatory flora (specifically the Snap-Vine), and temporal distortions.

### The Ruling Faction: The Root-Walkers
Guardians of the Glade, the **Root-Walkers** are druids who bond their souls with the forest. They reject technology and view the mining of Aether Crystals as a physical wound upon the world.

* **Leader:** **Matriarch Elara**. A centenarian druid whose skin has begun to turn to bark. She is wise but deeply xenophobic regarding those who carry technology.
* **Political Stance:** **Hostile**. The Root-Walkers are currently in a state of guerilla warfare against the Synod of Synthetics. They are wary of travelers but will aid those who show respect to the "Old Growth."

## Region 3: The Iron Depths
**Description:**
Beneath the crust of the southern badlands lies The Iron Depths, a subterranean network of caverns, mines, and foundries. The heat is oppressive, fueled by the magma flows of the world's core. This is the industrial heart of Aetheria, where the sky is made of rock and the rivers flow with molten metal.

* **Climate:** Sweltering heat, sulfurous air.
* **Hazards:** Cave-ins, Magma tides, Gas pockets.

### The Ruling Faction: The Ember-Forged
The **Ember-Forged** are master smiths and miners who worship the planet's core as a sleeping god. They are hardy, stubborn, and physically imposing, often wearing heavy thermal armor.

* **Leader:** **Overseer Krog**. A massive dwarf with a beard singed by dragon-fire. Krog values strength and honesty above all else. He runs the Depths like a military camp.
* **Political Stance:** **Friendly**. The Ember-Forged rely on trade to survive. They export refined ore and weapons to everyone, maintaining a strict neutrality in the war between the Spires and the Glade. However, they despise thieves.

## Inter-Regional Travel Rules
Travel between these disparate regions is not merely a matter of walking; the magical pressure variance between zones is lethal to the unprepared.

### The Harmonic Resonator
To cross the borders (known as **The Schisms**) between The Neon Spires, The Whispering Glade, and The Iron Depths, a traveler must possess a **Harmonic Resonator**.

* **Function:** This device attunes the traveler's personal bio-rhythm to the ambient magic of the destination region.
* **Penalty:** Crossing a Schism without a Resonator results in **"Aether-Sickness,"** a condition that causes hallucinations, mana-bleed, and eventually, crystallization of the blood.
* **Acquisition:** Resonators can only be calibrated by the **Guild of Wayfarers**, a neutral third party found at major crossroads.
