You see, iron is not just a metal, but a conduit for the flow of magical energy. It acts as a grounding rod, absorbing and disrupting the intricate balance of mana that governs our world.\n\n(Waving my hand, I conjure a faint aura around you) When a mage dons iron armor, their own life force is disrupted by the interference. The metal prevents the free flow of magic, rendering it nearly impossible to cast spells. It's as if the armor creates a barrier, shielding not just your body, but also your inner energy from being accessed.\n\n(My eyes seem to bore into yours) I've seen mages struggle with this limitation, their willpower and focus faltering under the weight of their own armor. Even the strongest mages can feel the strain, their magic dwindling as they try to push through the interference.\n\n(I take a step closer, my voice taking on a hint of mystery) But there are those who have learned to harness this limitation, bending the Law of Iron Interference to their will. They wield it like a sword, using its power to amplify their own abilities... and unlock secrets that others can only dream of.\n\n(My gaze lingers on you, searching for something within your eyes) Tell me, do you feel the weight of iron around you? Do you sense the potential for power hidden beneath its surface?",

But, as we now know, their recklessness was boundless.\n\nThe drill pierced the Ley-Weave, shattering the delicate balance between our world and the mysteries beneath.
